# *LENS<sub>PEMS</sub>*: evaLuation framEwork for autoNomous Systems (LENS) for Programmable Electronic Medical Systems (PEMS)

The Web page of this reporsitory is available at this [link](https://martins83.github.io/LENS/).

LENS is a framework for evaluating autonomous systems whose preliminary version is part of a research work published in [ACSOS 2022](https://2022.acsos.org/) and available [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9935081):

This web page provides supplemental material related to the article titled **"_Evaluation Framework for Autonomous Systems: the case of PEMS_"** and submitted to the [IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering journal](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/aboutJournal.jsp?punumber=32). LENS is an instrument to make an assessment of a system under the lens of abilities related to adaptation and smartness, and then to help software engineers in understanding in which direction is worth investing in to make their system smarter. It also helps to identify possible improvement directions and to plan for concrete activities. Finally, it helps to make a re-assessment when the improvement has been performed in order to check whether the plan has been accomplished.

## **Abilities in LENS<sub>PEMS</sub>** 
The Figure [Mapping the MAR abilities to LENS<sub>PEMS</sub>](https://github.com/Martins83/LENS/blob/main/Mapping%20table%20MAR%20LENS_PEMS.pdf) shows the abilities of LENS<sub>PEMS</sub> as the outcome of investigating the suitability of the MAR abilities for PEMS. For each ability, we also show the various ability levels. We highlight that we do not report those abilities and sub-abilities that do not apply to medical devices.
In the Figure, changes are highlighted with blue text (additive change) and gray strike-through text (reductive change). Lastly, gray cells identify those levels that have been completely removed. They cause a reduction in the levels numbering, by generating a mismatch between the numbering of MAR abilities and LENS<sub>PEMS</sub> abilities levels. 

## **Validation of LENS<sub>PEMS</sub>** 
We organized the validation of the LENS<sub>PEMS</sub> framework into the following three RQs, for which we provide the relevant documents.

> ### **RQ1 (Applicability):** How LENS<sub>PEMS</sub> is applicable to real PEMS?
> To validate the applicability of LENS<sub>PEMS</sub>, we show, in the article, its use in practice to evaluate a real PEMS, namely a mechanical ventilator (MVM), which has been developed during the COVID-19 pandemic also by most of the authors of this work [1].
> * The LENS<sub>PEMS</sub> framework can be found [here](https://foselab.github.io/LENS4PEMS/).
> * For convenience, we also report the [evaluation of the MVM case study](), as generated from the framework.
>   

> ### **RQ2 (Generalizability):** To what extent LENS<sub>PEMS</sub> is generalizable to the PEMS class of systems?
>
> List of PEMS evaluated for the generalizability of LENS: (add refs here and at the end of the page)

> List of relevant documents produced for generalizability:

 > * [Insuline Pumps Evaluation](https://github.com/Martins83/LENS/blob/main/LENS_INSULINE_PUMP_GSSI.docx)


> ### **RQ3 (Usefulness):** How LENS<sub>PEMS</sub> is useful in making an assessment of a PEMS and identifying possible directions of improvement towards smartness?
> To answer to this question we followed a mixed research methodology, including answers to a questionnaire and interviews.
> * The questionnaire is available [here](https://github.com/Martins83/LENS/blob/main/LENS4PEMS%20-%20Google%20Forms.pdf)
> * The anonymous responses to the questionnaire are available [here]() - TO BE ADDED
> * The transcription of interviews are available [here]() - TO BE ADDED
